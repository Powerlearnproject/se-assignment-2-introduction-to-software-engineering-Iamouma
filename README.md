Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes on flexibility, customer collaboration and rapid delivery of small, functional pieces of software. Requirements can evolve based on feedback and changing business needs.Teams are self-organixzd and consisy of cross-functional members who work collaboratively.

Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next one. Extensive documentation is created and maintained throughout the process and requirenments are gathered at the beginning and are expected to be stable and unchanging.

Key differences:

Approach - Waterfall model follows a linear and sequential approach while, Agile model follows a  Iterative and incremental approach.

Flexibility- Waterfall model is inflexible, with fixed requirements while, Agile model is highly flexible, accommodating changes throughout the project.

Customer Involvement - Waterfall model is limited to the initial requirements phase while, Agile model has continuous involvement throughout the development process.

Testing - Waterfall model testing occurs after the implementation phase while, Agile model testing is integrated into every iteration or sprint.

Documentation - Waterfall model has extensive and detailed documentation while, Agile model has less emphasis on documentation, focusing more on working software.

Suitable scenarios:

Suitable scenarios for agile model are, evolving requirements, customer-centric projects, innovative and complex projects.

Suitable scenarios for waterfall model are, clear and unchanging requirementrs, regulatory compliance and short-term projects.



# 4. Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is a systematic process involved in identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a software system. It is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the final product meets the intended purpose and satisfies all stakeholders' expectations.

Requirements engineering is fundamental to the success of any software development project.

By investing time and effort in a thorough requirements engineering process, organizations can significantly increase the likelihood of project success and customer satisfaction.







# 5. Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is the principle of dividing a software system into distinct, self-contained units or modules, each of which encapsulates a specific piece of functionality. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently but work together to form the complete system. Modularity is a key concept in software engineering because it improves the maintainability, scalability, and overall quality of software systems.

Improved Maintainability:

Isolation of Changes - Changes in one module can be made with minimal impact on other modules. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs when modifications are made.

Easier Debugging - Problems can be isolated and fixed within a specific module without the need to understand the entire system.

Simplified Testing - Individual modules can be tested independently, making it easier to identify and resolve defects.Enhanced Scalability:

Incremental Development - New features can be added by developing new modules or enhancing existing ones, without affecting the whole system.

Resource Management - Different modules can be deployed across various servers or environments to distribute load and improve performance.

Parallel Development - Multiple teams can work on different modules simultaneously, speeding up the development process and enabling scalability in team size and project complexity.
